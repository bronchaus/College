In September 1993, the computer systems industry, in the form of a group of 75 leading system and software vendors, agreed to back an initiative to ask X/Open Company to standardize the specifications of the UNIX operating system. In a parallel move, Novell, Inc. announced that it would transfer the UNIX trade mark, which it owned, to X/Open Company Limited (now part of The Open Group).

In a few weeks and two announcements, the computer industry put behind it over 25 years of policy and technical differences to concentrate on delivering a single specification for the UNIX system to the market with the aim of creating a consistent volume market for UNIX systems. All major vendors, including those that would continue to develop and maintain their own implementations of their operating system, agreed that they would ensure that their operating system products would meet a single comprehensive standard specification for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

This set of specifications would contain about 1170 separate APIs and be derived from those used by the most popular business applications running on UNIX systems. It was therefore able to deliver to market the benefits of a single, standard operating system: application and information portability, flexibility and freedom of choice for customers.

This industry initiative worked through the proven processes of X/Open Company to develop a set of specifications by broad industry consensus, supported by a testing and branding program, that would deliver commonality across multiple implementations of UNIX systems. The early specification (known then as Spec 1170), took into account the interfaces utilized by the most widely used UNIX system applications to ensure historical application compatibility. This Single UNIX Specification now defines products that are called UNIX, and is backed by the X/Open branding program.
