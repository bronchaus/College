Minister for Health Mary Harney has said she does not believe the agreement on hospital consultant contracts will come unstuck. Ms Harney said she believes the vast majority of the existing 2,000 consultants will opt to sign up to the new contracts, and that the health system will also recruit a further 2,000 consultants.
