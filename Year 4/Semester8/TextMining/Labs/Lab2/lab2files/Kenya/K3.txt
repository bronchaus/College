Former UN chief Kofi Annan says he has seen 'gross and systematic human rights abuses' in western Kenya after violence sparked by contested presidential elections last month. Mr Annan made the comment in the Rift Valley on the fifth day of his visit to Kenya, which has been plagued by ethnic clashes since the disputed elections. At least 26 people were killed in the Rift Valley province today.
