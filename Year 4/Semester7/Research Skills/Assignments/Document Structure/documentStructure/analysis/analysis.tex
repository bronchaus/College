\chapter*{Analysis and Design}
\section{Introduction}
Provide introduction in tot he the analysis and design phase.
Discuss how I will assess the chapter and what frameworks i will be using
\section{Proposed Methodologies}
Discuss the tutorials I will be following to create small Java applications
with each of the four frameworks
\subsection{Tutorials}
\subsection{Framework Features}

\section{Use Cases}
Draw use case diagrams for each tutorial. This will give visual aid to help
understand the process involving each framework
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 1}
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 2}
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 3}
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 4}

\section{Sequence Diagrams}
May or May not need depending on how complex the tutorials for each 
framework are.
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 1}
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 2}
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 3}
\subsection{Diagram for Turotial 4}

\section{Tutorial Documentation}
Document how all details about what the tutorial should achieve and how
it's planned to achieve it. try get tutorials that showcase frameworks specific ability
\subsection{Documentation for Framework 1}
\subsection{Documentation for Framework 2}
\subsection{Documentation for Framework 3}
\subsection{Documentation for Framework 4}

\section{Conclusion}
Provide a compilation of how this chapter took shape, how it evolved and how it changed
Did I meet my goals and did everything work?
