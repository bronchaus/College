\chapter*{Testing and Evaluation}
\section{Introduction}
Discuss the chapter and how I am comparing the tutorials I made last chapter.
How I plan on comparing, Developing one of the frameworks in to a bigger application
\section{Framework Comparrison}
Comparing the frameworks by intuitive, learnable, speed of coding, complexity,
size of classes, community support, removal of code affect
\subsection{How to Compare Frameworks}
\subsection{Existing Frameworks}

\section{Community Support}
Talk about the evaluation of community support after asking questions
in frameworks relative forums and open forums like stack overflow
\subsection{Spring Forum Support}
\subsection{Hibernate Forum Support}
\subsection{GWT Forum Support}
\subsection{Vaadin Forum Support}
\subsection{External Forum Support}
discuss open forums not directly associated with any framework

\section{Prototype Implementation}
Develop a larger application in either Hibernate or Spring (probably).
Application doesnt have to be huge but should be prototype for this project
\subsection{Design UML}
use case, sequence diagram, EER diagrams
\subsection{Process Documentation}
Detail steps durning development

\section{Prototype Testing}
Unit test the application, Web test the application, Fix potential bugs
\subsection{Documentation}

\section{Conclusion}
Describe the components of this chapter, difficulty comparing frameworks, community support
and the development proccess for project prototype
