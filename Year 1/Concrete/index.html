			Hello.
			</h1>
			<p>
			My name is David Kelly and I am a first year Computer Science Student and IT Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland. I suppose I have created this website to showcase what I have learned since beginning this course and to see what does and doesn't work on a live web page. <br>e.g correct grammer and misspeling, <strong>complimenting colour schemes</strong> and <em id="color"> subtle styles</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
			This website might be empty at this moment in time, but I will be updating it and keeping my skills in check on a regular basis. feel free to drop by and nose through any or all things and be sure to visit Trip City when it is completed, It will surely be funky if nothing else
			</p>
			<p>
			I suppose Bronchausvision has got to go at some point, it's a silly old name for my portfolio page. For the moment though I will have the websites and projects I have created on that page. Fans of Community make sure you check out the glossary page (it's streets ahead).

			Just click the picture above and it'll take you straight to it. enjoy.

			Welcome to bronchaus.
			</h3>
			<p>
			This website is a trial and error based first attempt at getting to grips with..... internets. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I don't know at the moment whether this is going to be some sort of cultural blog <em>(probably not)</em>, A portfolio website <em>(likely)</em> or some other new age attempt of bridging the gap between man and machine ever closer. Heralding a new age, typified by man and machine living as one and co-existing peacefully with fish & phish.
			</p>
			<p>
			Join me on this meandering journey as we set sail for parts unknown. Hopefully we can all pick up a few nuggets of interest along the away or if not, we can all at least make up lies and tell people that the numbers crunch and the facts have figures.
