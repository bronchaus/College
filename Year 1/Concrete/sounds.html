			Welcome to bronchaus.
			</h3>
			<p>
			This website is a trial and error based first attempt at getting to grips with..... internets. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I don't know at the moment whether this is going to be some sort of cultural blog <em>(probably not)</em>, A portfolio website <em>(likely)</em> or some other new age attempt of bridging the gap between man and machine ever closer. Heralding a new age, typified by man and machine living as one and co-existing peacefully with fish & phish.
			</p>
			<p>
			Join me on this meandering journey as we set sail for parts unknown. Hopefully we can all pick up a few nuggets of interest along the away or if not, we can all at least make up lies and tell people that the numbers crunch and the facts have figures.
