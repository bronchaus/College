

to set up initially
install GIT , make sure use git in windows is ticked, otherwise you will use it using git's own command line
you can do that but i found it a bit harder to learn
you set up a folder on windows....this will be where your project will be, it should be blank.
now go into the command line and change directory to that folder

go into this link
https://github.com/Michaelcj10/Fantasy_Hurling
there is an option to right to 'fork' the project into you, do it.
now you have that folder added to your stuff.



in the command line do 'git init' , this sets up thi folder as a git folder
now do 
git pull https://github.com/Michaelcj10/Fantasy_Hurling.git
this will stick all the crap we have into that folder....... so now you are up to date




1.before you start to write your code make sur you are up to date with what we did:
git pull https://github.com/Michaelcj10/Fantasy_Hurling.git
this update your local project with changes I did and uploaded into web repo


2.then you work on the project
you can see changes with git status and details with git diff
you can see help with git --help or help about a command git status --help (help about status git command)

3.when you done for a day do:
git add -A
this will add all changes
git commit -m "some meaningful message about the work you done this time"
$git push https://github.com/Michaelcj10/Fantasy_Hurling.git
this will upload the commit to web repo so I can pull them before I start my work 


to reset local to what is in the repos ( if you mess up and dont know what to do , do these two , it reverts to whats on github, ive used this loads!!)

git fetch https://github.com/Michaelcj10/Fantasy_Hurling.git

git reset --hard HEAD
