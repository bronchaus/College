    	"Times New Romans? is a project Jonathan undertook at the beginning of 2013. The idea of the project was to question the beauty within type face and the literal ability of creating faces related to certain fonts.Times New Roman gets its name from the Times of London, the British newspaper. In 1929, the Times hired typographer Stanley Morison of Monotype, a British font foundry, to create a new text font."

    	"The project stemmed form the use 'face' in typeface... Jonathan can see the individual style and 'face' in each font. The idea was to incorporate and capture each subtle nuance for each font. The project Began with Times New Roman and the finished work is open to interpretation, However Jonathan feels that the image is pretty and clear. It depicts a certain biblical figure who had trouble with Romans of his own."
